### Hi there 😆

I am now a new graduate in [College of Semiconductor Research (CoSR)](https://cosr.site.nthu.edu.tw/) department in [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/). 

💡 I feel interested in circuit design after taking some courses about analog and digital circuit design. I am also curious about other fields like computer science, machine learning, signal processing, etc. Therefore, I have taken some introduction courses about them and hope that I can combine their knowledge with circuit design.

📝 I am working on "SoC Design" course this semester, and I will keep writing a study journal throughout this course to record what I learn and achieve. You can click on [this link](https://hackmd.io/@whywhytellmewhy/S1joJxm1p) to see it.
