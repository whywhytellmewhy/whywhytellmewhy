### Hi there 😆

I am now a new graduate in [College of Semiconductor Research (CoSR)](https://cosr.site.nthu.edu.tw/) department in [National Tsing Hua University (NTHU)](https://www.nthu.edu.tw/). 

💡 I feel interested in circuit design after taking some courses about analog and digital circuit design. I am also curious about other fields like computer science, machine learning, signal processing, etc. Therefore, I have taken some introduction courses about them and hope that I can combine their knowledge with circuit design.
